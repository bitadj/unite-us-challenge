# Unite Us Coding Challenge

Bita Djaghouri | [@bitadj](https://github.com/bitadj)

## Tools Used
- Node.js
- React / React-Dom
- Create React App
- `request-promise` package
- Bootstrap CSS and Grid System
- Docker
- Unite Us Docker Fake API


## Notes 
- I used the ejected version of `Create React App` to quickly scaffold the project in order to avoid the lengthy setup for babel and webpack. 
- `Create React App` has a number of packages and dependancies, but in building the page itself, I primarily stuck with vanilla Javascript and HTML/CSS. 
- TDD - Although, I ordinarily subscribe to a policy of test-driven development, my recent upgrade to  `Node v.8` has caused `Jest` to behave in unexpected ways for me. Thus, I am submitting the untested version at this time.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. Thank you.
